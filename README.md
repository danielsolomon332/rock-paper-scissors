# rock-paper-scissors


## Overview
My app allows the user to play the game: Rock/Paper/Scissors. This includes a classic and difficult version of the game. The difficult version has the following choices: Rock/Paper/Scissors/Lizard/Alien. Using localStorage, the app will count your wins or losses and these values will persist on page refresh.

- This app is currently a private repository on GitHub, but it will be made public soon!

- Please view the installation and game instructions below!

## How to install the app

1. Locate the folder on your local machine that you would like to clone the repository into.

2. Navigate your web browser to this ![page](https://github.com/danielsolomon332/rock-paper-scissors)

3. Click the green "code" button (make sure SSH is selected), then click the keyboard icon.

4. Finally, in your terminal, type: git clone git@github.com:danielsolomon332/rock-paper-scissors.git

5. Then you can open the app's code in your favorite text editor.

## How To Use

1. When you open the app you will see a home screen that displays the primary sections: human(where the human wins are counted), computer(where the computer wins are counted), and the middle game selection section(where you will choose your game type).

2. If the "Classic" game button is clicked, the Rock/Paper/Scissors fighter options will now appear in the middle section to be chosen from for the game by the user.

3. If the "Difficult" game button is clicked, the Rock/Paper/Scissors/Lizard/Alien fighter options will now appear in the middle section to be chosen from for the game by the user.

4. Once the user clicks one of the fighter images, a brief matchup view will occur. This will show the image chosen by the user on the left and the randomly generated computer fighter image on the right. This matchup view will also exclaim the winner at the top of the page. Don't blink, or else you might miss the win, lose, or tie message at the top! Lastly, either the Human or Computer win total will be increased depending on the outcome (or a tie will keep the win totals the same as they were).

5. After one or more games are played, a "CHANGE GAME?" button will appear on the left side of the page. If the user clicks this button, it will take them back to the home screen, in case they want to change game types.

6. Please have fun playing this game and make sure to try all of the different fighter options!

## Reflections

1. This app was a lot of fun to design! Improving my understanding and use of flex box made the HTML/CSS organization much easier than previous projects. It was enjoyable to try and implement the "hover" functionality within my CSS for the classic and difficult game buttons!

2. Locating exactly which DOM elements to hide and show at specific times was a challenge. It was not uncommon for me to have extra images or views on the page at the same time, before rethinking and refactoring my code.

3. There are definitely opportunities and locations where I could attempt to write DRYer code, but with all of the time and effort put into this project, I was very happy to finally have a fully functional app!

4. Working with Classes in Javascript is still a challenge and it took me a long time to make sure I was using the correct dot notation within my functions. This was a great learning opportunity however, and I will be gleaning a lot of new and improved knowledge away from this project!
